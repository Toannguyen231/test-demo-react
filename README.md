## 💡 Project Overview

**Project Quiz** is a comprehensive Single Page Application (SPA) designed for online examinations, academic assessments, and candidate skill evaluations. It delivers two tailored experiences within a single unified platform:

1. **Candidate Assessment Portal**: An interactive, responsive test-taking interface equipped with a real-time countdown timer, question-jumping sidebar, image zoom lightbox, and immediate score breakdown upon submission.
2. **Instructor & Admin Command Center**: A rich dashboard featuring paginated User Management (CRUD), Quiz Creation (with cover image upload & difficulty levels), dynamic Question & Multi-Choice Answer builders, and statistical overview cards.
